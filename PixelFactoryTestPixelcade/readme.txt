PixelAnimate2
============

Use this one instead of PixelAnimate. This is a more efficient way to do the animations. Here we are doing a one time de-code of each animated .gif and then saving the decoded native .rgb565 files into Android local storage. Then we simply load each .rgb565 one at a timer with a timer to make the animation. We read the animation delay from the initial animated .gif and also store that locally.

Ex.

Original file is rain.gif
which is stored like this: pixel/pixelpiledriver/rain.gif

after the one time decode, we'll have this:

pixel/pixelpiledriver/decoded/rain/rain.txt
pixel/pixelpiledriver/decoded/rain/rain1.rgb565
pixel/pixelpiledriver/decoded/rain/rain2.rgb565
pixel/pixelpiledriver/decoded/rain/rain3.rgb565
pixel/pixelpiledriver/decoded/rain/rain4.rgb565
and so on per how many frames

rain.txt will have this format

resolution of LED matrix, total frames, time delay

so

32,105,60

32: which means 32x32 matrix (as opposed to 16x32), we know if it's 32x32 or 16x32 from the apps prefs
105: means 105 total frames
60: means 60 ms delay to use in between frames for the timer

Each time we run the animation, we first read rain.txt to know what matrix to use, how many frame we're going to be loading, and at what timer frequency we should be loading those frames
